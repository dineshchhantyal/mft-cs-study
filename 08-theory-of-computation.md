# Theory of Computation & Formal Languages — MFT CS Study Guide

**Weight on exam:** ~5–10% of ETS MFT CS (May 1, 2026)
**Why it matters:** Easy points if you memorize closure tables + Chomsky hierarchy. MFT loves trick questions on "is this regular / CFL / decidable?"

## 1. Foundations

### Alphabets, Strings, Languages
- **Alphabet (Σ):** finite non-empty set of symbols (e.g., {0,1}).
- **String:** finite sequence over Σ. Empty string = **ε** (|ε| = 0).
- **Σ\*** = set of all finite strings over Σ (including ε). Always **countably infinite**.
- **Σ⁺** = Σ\* \ {ε}.
- **Language:** any subset L ⊆ Σ\*. Number of possible languages over Σ is **uncountable** (2^ℵ₀) — so most languages are not describable by any finite machine.
- **Kleene star:** A\* = ⋃_{i≥0} Aⁱ. Note A⁰ = {ε} always, so ε ∈ A\* for every A (even A = ∅; ∅\* = {ε}).

### String operations
- Concatenation: |xy| = |x|+|y|; associative, not commutative.
- Reverse: (xy)ᴿ = yᴿxᴿ.

---

## 2. Regular Languages

### Regular Expressions
**Operators** (precedence high→low): **\* (Kleene)** > **concatenation** > **|  (union)**.

**Identities:**
- R | R = R (idempotent)
- (R\*)\* = R\*
- ε | RR\* = R\*
- (R|S)\* = (R\*S\*)\* = (R\* | S\*)\*
- ∅R = R∅ = ∅; εR = Rε = R
- ∅\* = ε\* = ε (denotes {ε})

### DFA — Deterministic Finite Automaton
**5-tuple:** M = (Q, Σ, δ, q₀, F)
- Q: finite states
- Σ: input alphabet
- δ: Q × Σ → Q (**total** function — exactly one transition per symbol)
- q₀ ∈ Q: start state
- F ⊆ Q: accept states

Accepts w iff δ̂(q₀, w) ∈ F.

### NFA (with ε-transitions)
- δ: Q × (Σ ∪ {ε}) → 2^Q (power set).
- Accepts if **some** computation ends in F.
- **Equivalence:** every NFA has an equivalent DFA (subset construction).
  - DFA states = subsets of NFA states → worst-case **2ⁿ** blowup.
  - Some languages genuinely need 2ⁿ DFA states (e.g., "n-th from end is 1").

### Equivalences (all equally powerful)
**Regex ⇔ NFA ⇔ DFA ⇔ Regular Grammar (right-linear)**
- **Thompson's construction:** regex → ε-NFA (linear size).
- **Subset construction:** NFA → DFA (exponential).
- **State elimination** / Arden's lemma: DFA → regex.

### Closure Properties (Regular Languages — all CLOSED)
| Operation | Regular? |
|---|---|
| Union | Yes |
| Intersection | Yes |
| Complement | Yes |
| Concatenation | Yes |
| Kleene star | Yes |
| Reverse | Yes |
| Homomorphism | Yes |
| Inverse homomorphism | Yes |
| Difference (L1 \ L2) | Yes |

### Pumping Lemma (Regular)
If L is regular, ∃ pumping length **p** such that every w ∈ L with |w| ≥ p can be split w = xyz with:
1. |xy| ≤ p
2. |y| ≥ 1
3. ∀ i ≥ 0, xyⁱz ∈ L

**Use:** Prove non-regular by contradiction. Adversary picks p; you pick w; adversary picks split; you pick i.

**Classic non-regular examples:**
- {aⁿbⁿ : n ≥ 0}
- {aⁿbⁿcⁿ}
- {wwᴿ : w ∈ {a,b}\*} (palindromes)
- {aᵖ : p prime}
- {aⁿ² : n ≥ 0}
- {w : #a(w) = #b(w)}
- {aⁿbᵐ : n ≠ m}  (careful — its complement w.r.t. a\*b\* isn't regular either)

### Myhill–Nerode Theorem
L is regular **iff** the relation "x ≡_L y  iff  ∀z: xz ∈ L ⇔ yz ∈ L" has **finitely many equivalence classes**. The number of classes = size of the minimum DFA. Gives:
- Lower bounds on DFA size.
- A non-regularity proof technique (exhibit infinitely many distinguishable prefixes).

### DFA Minimization
- Remove unreachable states.
- Merge equivalent states via **table-filling (partition refinement)**: start with {F, Q\F}; split if any symbol leads to different classes. Result is **unique** up to renaming.

---

## 3. Context-Free Languages

### CFG — Context-Free Grammar
G = (V, Σ, R, S) where rules look like A → α with A ∈ V, α ∈ (V ∪ Σ)\*.
- **Leftmost / rightmost derivation:** always expand leftmost / rightmost nonterminal.
- **Parse tree:** yields equivalent derivation up to order.
- **Ambiguous:** some string has ≥2 parse trees. Some CFLs are **inherently ambiguous** (e.g., {aⁱbʲcᵏ : i=j or j=k}).

### PDA — Pushdown Automaton
CFG ≡ **nondeterministic** PDA. **DPDA < NPDA** (deterministic is strictly weaker).
- Example CFL not accepted by any DPDA: {wwᴿ : w ∈ {a,b}\*} (even-length palindromes).
- DCFLs are closed under complement; CFLs are NOT.

### Normal Forms
- **Chomsky Normal Form (CNF):** A → BC or A → a (plus S → ε if ε ∈ L). Enables **CYK parsing** in O(n³).
- **Greibach Normal Form (GNF):** A → aα where α ∈ V\*. Derivations have length = |string|.

### Pumping Lemma for CFLs
If L is CFL, ∃ p such that every w with |w| ≥ p can be split w = uvxyz with:
1. |vxy| ≤ p
2. |vy| ≥ 1
3. ∀ i ≥ 0, uvⁱxyⁱz ∈ L

**Classic non-CFLs:**
- {aⁿbⁿcⁿ}
- {ww : w ∈ {a,b}\*}   (note: wwᴿ IS CFL, but ww is not)
- {aⁱbʲcᵏ : i ≤ j ≤ k}
- {aᵖ : p prime}

### Closure Properties (CFLs)
| Operation | CFL closed? |
|---|---|
| Union | **Yes** |
| Concatenation | **Yes** |
| Kleene star | **Yes** |
| Reverse | **Yes** |
| Homomorphism | **Yes** |
| **Intersection** | **NO** |
| **Complement** | **NO** |
| CFL ∩ Regular | **YES** (special case — memorize!) |
| Difference | NO |

**Proof sketch that CFLs not closed under ∩:** {aⁿbⁿcᵐ} and {aᵐbⁿcⁿ} are both CFL; their intersection is {aⁿbⁿcⁿ}, which is not.

## 4. Chomsky Hierarchy

| Type | Name | Grammar form | Accepting machine | Example |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **3** | Regular | A → aB, A → a | DFA / NFA | a\*b\* |
| **2** | Context-Free | A → α (α ∈ (V∪Σ)\*) | NPDA | aⁿbⁿ |
| **1** | Context-Sensitive | αAβ → αγβ, \|γ\|≥1 | Linear-Bounded Automaton (LBA) | aⁿbⁿcⁿ |
| **0** | Recursively Enumerable (RE) | any α → β | Turing Machine | halting problem |

Strict inclusions: **Type 3 ⊊ Type 2 ⊊ Type 1 ⊊ Type 0**.
Also: **Decidable (recursive)** sits strictly between Type 1 and Type 0.

---

## 5. Turing Machines & Computability

### Turing Machine
M = (Q, Σ, Γ, δ, q₀, q_accept, q_reject) where Γ ⊇ Σ ∪ {⊔} is tape alphabet.
- **All variants equivalent in power:** multi-tape, nondeterministic, 2-way infinite tape, RAM — all accept the same class (RE).
- Nondeterministic TM = Deterministic TM in power (but may differ in time).

### Recognizable vs Decidable
- **Turing-recognizable (RE):** some TM accepts exactly L (may loop on non-members).
- **Turing-decidable (recursive):** some TM always halts, accepting L, rejecting ~L.
- **Decidable = RE ∩ co-RE.** If both L and Lᶜ are RE, then L is decidable.

### Halting Problem
HALT = {⟨M, w⟩ : M halts on w}.
- **HALT is RE** (simulate; accept if halts).
- **HALT is undecidable** (Turing, 1936 — diagonalization).
- **HALTᶜ is not even RE.**

**Diagonalization sketch:** Suppose decider H exists. Define D(⟨M⟩) = "if H says M halts on ⟨M⟩, loop; else halt." Then D(⟨D⟩) contradicts.

### Rice's Theorem
Every **non-trivial semantic property** of RE languages is **undecidable**.
- "Non-trivial" = some TM has it, some doesn't.
- "Semantic" = depends only on L(M), not the description of M.
- Examples undecidable by Rice: L(M)=∅, L(M) regular, L(M)=Σ\*, M accepts 42, L(M₁)=L(M₂).
- **Syntactic** properties (e.g., "M has ≥5 states") are NOT covered and may be decidable.

### Reductions
**Mapping (many-one) reduction** A ≤ₘ B: computable f with x ∈ A ⇔ f(x) ∈ B.
- If B decidable ⇒ A decidable.
- Contrapositive: if A undecidable ⇒ B undecidable.
- If B ∈ RE ⇒ A ∈ RE.

---

## 6. Complexity

### Classes
- **P:** decidable in polynomial time by deterministic TM.
- **NP:** verifiable in poly time (equivalently, poly-time nondeterministic TM).
- **co-NP:** complement in NP.
- **PSPACE:** poly space.
- **EXPTIME:** 2^poly(n) time.

### Known inclusions
**P ⊆ NP ⊆ PSPACE ⊆ EXPTIME**
**P ⊆ co-NP ⊆ PSPACE**
**Proven strict:** P ⊊ EXPTIME (time hierarchy theorem). All other inclusions are open (P vs NP is the famous one).

### NP-completeness
L is **NP-hard** if every A ∈ NP reduces (poly-time) to L.
L is **NP-complete** if NP-hard AND L ∈ NP.

**Cook–Levin (1971):** SAT is NP-complete.

**Classic NP-complete problems (memorize):**
- SAT, 3-SAT, CIRCUIT-SAT
- CLIQUE, INDEPENDENT-SET, VERTEX-COVER (all three trivially inter-reducible)
- HAM-PATH, HAM-CYCLE
- TSP (decision version)
- SUBSET-SUM, PARTITION, KNAPSACK (decision)
- 3-COLORING
- SET-COVER

**Not NP-complete (in P):** 2-SAT, matching, Eulerian path, minimum spanning tree, shortest path, linear programming, primality (AKS 2002).

### ✅ Answer Key & Explanations

**Q1. (c) 8.** For the k-th last symbol condition, a DFA needs 2ᵏ states; here k=3 → 2³ = 8.

**Q2. (b) (a*b*)*.** Generates all strings over {a,b}. (a) misses 'ba'; (c) misses ε; (d) misses mixed strings.

**Q3. (c) 2ⁿ.** Subset construction — each DFA state is a subset of NFA states.

**Q4. (b) CFLs.** Classic trap: CFLs are NOT closed under intersection or complement. All others are closed under intersection.

**Q5. (c).** {aⁿbⁿcⁿ} is the canonical non-CFL but is context-sensitive (and decidable).

**Q6. (b) A stack.** The defining feature of a PDA.

**Q7. (b) DPDA strictly < NPDA.** Unlike DFAs/NFAs, determinism reduces power for PDAs (e.g., {wwᴿ} is CFL but not DCFL).

**Q8. (b) {wwᴿ}.** Classic palindrome-like CFL accepted by NPDA. {ww} is NOT a CFL — the stack can't match a string to itself in order.

**Q9. (b) Context-free.** CFL ∩ Regular = CFL — standard closure property and common MFT trap.

**Q10. (b).** Checking if a CFG generates ε is decidable. All others are undecidable by Rice's theorem or reduction from halting.

**Q11. (c).** Number of states is a syntactic property of M, not a semantic property of L(M), so Rice doesn't apply. All others are nontrivial semantic properties → undecidable.

**Q12. (c).** L is decidable iff both L and Lᶜ are RE (by the RE ∩ co-RE = decidable theorem).

**Q13. (b) 2-SAT.** 2-SAT is in P (via implication graph / SCCs); 3-SAT is NP-complete — key trap.

**Q14. (b) A ∈ P.** Polynomial-time reductions preserve P membership downward.

**Q15. (c) 3-SAT.** Cook–Levin theorem; 2-SAT is in P; sorting and matrix multiplication are in P.

**Q16. (a).** Standard CFL pumping lemma statement — |vxy| ≤ p, |vy| ≥ 1.

**Q17. (c).** Every CFL is decidable (CYK algorithm, O(n³)). (a) false (halting is RE not decidable), (b) false, (d) false.

**Q18. (c) Context-sensitive.** Chomsky hierarchy: Type-0 RE, Type-1 CSL, Type-2 CFL, Type-3 Regular.

**Q19. (c) co-RE but not RE.** E_TM is co-RE (can enumerate non-empty witnesses) but not RE — reduction from HALT complement.

**Q20. (b).** HALT is the canonical RE-but-undecidable language. Its complement is NOT RE (it's co-RE only).
